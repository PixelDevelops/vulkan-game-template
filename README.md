# Vulkan Game Template
This is a project template for making a game with the Vulkan SDK. It comes with shader files, which have already been compiled into a .spv file format for you. The template also already has the window set up.

**This project template utilizes the libraries GLM (Open GL Mathematics) and GLFW, as well as the Vulkan SDK. This project template is assuming that you have the C/C++ Visual Studio Code Extension Pack installed, with all of the extensions in the pack enabled.**

The project template comes with:
- Shader compiler (Windows Batch)
- First app files (.cpp and .hpp)
- Lve window files (.cpp and .hpp)
- Main program files (.cpp)
- Shaders folder, with .spv shaders in it

## Making sure your computer can handle Vulkan
Before you start making your game with this project template, you'll need to make sure that your device can handle Vulkan and other libraries that you may have installed. To do this, search up `Vulkan Cube` in your operating system's search bar. If you get a cube that is grey and has the LunarG logo on all six faces, your good to go.

## Other important information
This project template assumes you are using C/C++ version 17, and that the IntelliSenseMode is `windows-msvc-x64`, and that the Windows SDK version is `10.0.19041.0`. You guys may also fork this repository in order to add on to it, and if you do, make sure to give credit to me and everyone else who has contributed to the original version.
